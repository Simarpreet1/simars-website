<h3> Cost Plus Pricing</h3>
<p> Markup pricing is another name for cost-plus pricing. This pricing strategy adds a set percentage to the price of producing a single unit of a good.</p>

<h3>Value Based</h3>
<p>a pricing method that bases prices mostly on how much a customer thinks something is worth. Value pricing is client-focused, which means that businesses set their prices based on what they believe a product is worth to the customer</p>

<h3>Competition Based</h3>
<p>is a pricing strategy in which the price points you set are strongly influenced by those of your rivals. This strategy places the market as its primary focus rather than your costs.</p>

<h3>Real Time Pricing</h3>
<p> often known as dynamic pricing, is a highly adaptable method of determining a product's or service's price. Dynamic pricing aims to enable businesses who offer products or services online to quickly modify prices in response to demand.</p>
